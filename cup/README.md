# theThreeCupShuffle
Implement the three cup shuffle game with one Cup application replicated three times and one Trickster that hosts the game. A third application with a UI will be provided to connect it to the endpoints of the Trickster. The Trickster will have the following endpoints: /play starts a new game, removes the coin from the Cups and hides one in one of them at random; /choose/{number} chooses one of the Cups and returns whether we guessed right.
